# NER Project

This is my NER project. Main.py contains preprocessing and model training, Test.py contains an example test case to display the model, App.py is the flask file that would connect the words to highlight from backend to frontend, popup.html is the html file for the actual extension, and manifest.json is the file describing google extensions.
